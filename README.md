# project


# In Week 1, I focused on planning and designing my task-tracking application. I defined the core features needed for a minimum working example (MWE), including the ability to add tasks, display a list of tasks, mark tasks as completed, and store tasks for at least the current session. This helped me clearly understand what the project needed to accomplish before writing any code.

# I also decided on the tools and technologies for the project. I chose Python as the programming language and planned to start with a simple command-line interface before expanding to a web-based version later. During this week, I thought through the basic layout of the program, how tasks would be stored (as a list with completion status), and how the user would interact with the system. This planning stage prepared me to begin implementation in Week 2.
